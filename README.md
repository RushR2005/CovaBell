# CovaBell

We have developed CovaBell, a smart doorbell and lock system to ensure visitors don’t show any Covid-19 symptoms.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, security guards and other people are deployed outside apartments, offices, and shops to check the temperature of people entering an area. This process is risky and might lead to the spread of infection from the guard to the person or vice-versa. Moreover, when people visit a house, they ring a bell. If a person is Covid-19 positive, the bell will get infected with the virus.

This project automates the checking of the temperature of people and allows them entry in areas such as shops, houses, offices, etc. It is a system comprising of an infrared sensor (which measures the temperature) and an oximeter, which evaluates the oxygen level in the body. We will take the vitals of the person and display it on an LCD screen whether the person can enter or not based on the result. A custom lock will be installed on the door to achieve this. If the health of the person based on the above factors is satisfactory, the system will open the door with the help of a servo motor.

It’s a contact-less way to measure the temperature of people; we remove the need for a human to do the same job. It helps to prevent symptomatic people from entering an area.
