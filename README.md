# CovaBell

We've introduced CovaBell, an innovative smart doorbell and lock system that aims to ensure visitors are not exhibiting any symptoms of Covid-19.


During the Covid-19 pandemic, we've seen security guards and others stationed outside apartments, offices, and shops to manually check people's temperatures upon entry. However, this process carries risks, potentially facilitating the transmission of the virus between the guard and the person being checked. Additionally, when visitors ring the doorbell of a house, there's a concern that the bell itself could become contaminated if the visitor is Covid-19 positive.


Our project automates the temperature screening process, allowing entry into various spaces such as shops, homes, and offices in a safer manner. It consists of an infrared sensor for temperature measurement and an oximeter to assess oxygen levels in the body. We collect the individual's vital data and display it on an LCD screen, determining whether they can enter based on the results. To facilitate entry, we install a customized lock on the door, which, if the person's health parameters are satisfactory, opens the door with the assistance of a servo motor.


This system offers a contactless approach to temperature screening, eliminating the need for human intervention. It plays a crucial role in preventing individuals with symptoms from entering a given area.
